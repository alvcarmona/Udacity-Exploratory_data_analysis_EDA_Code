## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

You can also embed plots, for example:



# Create a histogram of diamond prices.
# Facet the histogram by diamond color
# and use cut to color the histogram bars.

# The plot should look something like this.
# http://i.imgur.com/b5xyrOu.jpg

# Note: In the link, a color palette of type
# 'qual' was used to color the histogram using
# scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual')

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.
```{r Price Histograms with Facet and Color}

 ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price))+ scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual') + 
  facet_wrap(~color)   + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) 

qplot(data=diamonds,x= price, fill= cut)+facet_wrap(~color)+ geom_bar()+ scale_fill_brewer(type= 'qual')+scale_x_log10()
```

```{r Price vs. Table Colored by Cut}
#http://i.imgur.com/rQF9jQr.jpg
 ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = table, y=price))+ scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual') + 
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) 

```
```{r Price vs. Volume and Diamond Clarity}
#http://i.imgur.com/excUpea.jpg
 ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = x*y*z, y=price))+ scale_fill_brewer(type = 'div') + 
  xlim(0,quantile(diamonds$y*diamonds$z*diamonds$x, 0.90)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = clarity))+ scale_y_log10()

```{r Proportion of Friendships Initiated }
# Many interesting variables are derived from two or more others.
# For example, we might wonder how much of a person's network on
# a service like Facebook the user actively initiated. Two users
# with the same degree (or number of friends) might be very
# different if one initiated most of those connections on the
# service, while the other initiated very few. So it could be
# useful to consider this proportion of existing friendships that
# the user initiated. This might be a good predictor of how active
# a user is compared with their peers, or other traits, such as
# personality (i.e., is this person an extrovert?).

# Your task is to create a new variable called 'prop_initiated'
# in the Pseudo-Facebook data set. The variable should contain
# the proportion of friendships that the user initiated.

pf <- transform(pf, prop_initiated = ifelse(friend_count == 0, 0, friendships_initiated/friend_count))



```

```{r prop_initiated vs. tenure }
# Create a line graph of the median proportion of
# friendships initiated ('prop_initiated') vs.
# tenure and color the line segment by
# year_joined.bucket.

# Recall, we created year_joined.bucket in Lesson 5
# by first creating year_joined from the variable tenure.
# Then, we used the cut function on year_joined to create
# four bins or cohorts of users.
